# WildlifeCamera

This project includes everything needed to capture images with a raspberry Pi, process them in AWS to categorise the images and use of 3d printer files to make a waterproof case for external mounting.

Once the project is completed using AWS, variations will be created using Azure and GCP for comparison.
